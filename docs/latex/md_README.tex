This repository is a simple compilation of naive implementations of common machine learning algorithms in c++.

Most of the impleentations are non regularized and are a mix of techniques from Andrew Ng\textquotesingle{}s course on coursera and Tom M. Mitchell\textquotesingle{}s book, \char`\"{}\+Machine Learning\char`\"{}.

Please install \href{http://arma.sourceforge.net/}{\tt armadillo} before trying out any of the examples.

\subsection*{Examples}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You can try out the implementations by running the examples in the Example folder
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item To run an example firslty change directory into the examples folder
\item Then run it using a c++ compiler (E.\+g. -\/ g++ Neural\+Network\+Example.\+cpp ../\+Neural\+Network.cpp -\/larmadillo)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item You can check out the datasets in Data/ folder in the Examples folder.
\item For data with low dimensionality you can always print output to a csv and plot to judge the results.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Documentation}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I have recently come across Doxygen as a documentation tool and have used it for the class documentation.
\item You can start reading the documentation by opening the index.\+html file in the html/ folder.
